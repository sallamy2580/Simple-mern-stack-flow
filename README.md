This project uses MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS and Node with a slight help of Axios.

This is a simple example of how to make a MERN stack application. The focus of this project is mainly on backend part and not the styling of the application. 

## Setting up the project locally

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

You need to first clone the repository by the following command 

`git clone https://github.com/rak-shit/MERN-stack-Todo.git`

Then you need to install add the dependencies in the root directory. This project mainly uses, `Express`, `Node`, `React`, `MongoDB` and `Axios`.

You first need to install node and setup the react develpment environment. Then you can download and install MongoDB from the official mongo website [MongoDB Download](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community). 

Then you can install dependencies like `Express`, `body-parser`, `cors`, `mongoose` and `nodemon` by the following command in the root directory or the server directory which is inside the root directory

`npm install express body-parser cors mongoose nodemon`

Then in the root directory install `Axios` using

`npm insall axios`

This step finishes the setting up of the project locally

## To run the server:

Go to the server directory and type the following command on the command line:

`nodemon index.js`

This will run the server on the `PORT 3000`.

## To run the client:

Go to the client directory and type the following command on the command line:

`npm start`

This will run the server on the `PORT 8000`.

## The detailed procedure of how to make your own MERN stack application will be uploaded on Medium soon. The link will be posted here.
